{{{ Emi's idea 

My idea was to have 4 perk slots for every loadout, namely a red perk (weapons), a green perk (Hull), a yellow perk (Kill rewards) and a blue perk (engine)

my proposed ideas for the perks in these categories are as follows

Green:
  -Heavy armor : Health increase
  -Armor plating : % damage reduction from specific sides, for example top and front, top and back, bottom and top, front and back the player would be able to choose this himself
  -Flexible wings : Increases turning speed and reduces speed lost on turning
  -Racer airframe : Higher top speed and stronger throttle speed 
  
Blue:
  -Energy Bank : Higher max energy
  -Reverse thrust : Increases the throttle change rate and allows you to have backwards thrusting.
  - ??? (name?) : slightly more potent afterburn (more energy cost aswell, but in an uneven ratio (3 thrust, 2 energy or something), and when you brake, you gain energy based on how much speed you reduce, this is a significant amount.
  - ???? 
  
Yellow:
  -Ace Instincts : Enables bars, stronger effects (Higher damage, higher energy regain and (slightly) better turning
  -Energy Leech : Killing enemies gives energy boosts.
  - ?? name ? : Enables bars, get rewarded twice the amount of bars for each kill.(may get removed in favor of a nicer idea)
  - ?? name ? : Enables bars, increases max potential bars, the effect of those will be greater than AI (may get removed in favor of a nicer idea)
